# Community Lighting
A community driven lighting plugin for RPG Maker MV and MZ

# Quickstart:

**If you want to have the demo:**
On the front Github page, click on CommunityLightingMVDemo.zip or CommunityLightingMZDemo.zip.
On the next screen, click the 'Download' button.
Don't use Save Link As, you will instead save an empty zip.

When the download is done, you can open as any MV/MZ project.

**If you want just to use the script:**

On the front Github page, click on Community_Lighting.js or Community_Lighting_MZ.js.
On the next screen, right-click the 'Raw' button, and choose Save Link As.
Don't use Save Link As on the front page, you will instead download a weird html version of the script.

Add it to your project as you will do with any other plugin.

# FAQ:

**-The demo doesn't work?**

Please make sure you downloaded the good file corresponding to you rpgmaker version, as described in the quickstart.
If you followed the instructions of the quickstart and still have problems with the demo,
please report it on the related thread on rpgmakerweb: https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/community-lighting-mv-mz.124274/.

**-Is the MV version of this plugin a direct update to Terrax Lighting? Can I migrate from Terrax Lighting to this plugin without additional effort?**

Yes to both. All the syntax is the same, however note that by default it now uses proper note tags for events.
This is so it can play better with other plugins that might also involve using note tags on events.

<cl: light 250 #ffffff> // community lighting version

light 250 #ffffff // original terrax version

You can switch back to the terrax formatting in the plugin parameters. (Parameter 'Note Tag Key', leave it blank to use Terrax's synthax.)

**-Do I still have to put at least one light event in order to activate the script on a map?**

There is now a plugin paramater ('Light event required') who allows you to have the plugin active even with no lightsource on a map.

**-How would I make the black areas not be pitch black?**

Use the set tint plugin command.

**-Why is the MV demo way bigger than the MZ one?**

MZ RTP graphics take very little disc space compared to the MV's ones.

**-What if I have questions not answered there?**

# Help File:

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Important info about note tags and the note tag key plugin paramter:  This
* plugin features an optional note tag key that lets this plugin's note tags
* work alongside those of other plugins--a feature not found in the original
* Terrax Lighting plugin. If a note tag key is set in the plugin paramters,
* all of these commands must be enclosed in a note tag with that particular
* key in in order to be recognized.
*
* This note tag key applies to anything this plugin would have placed inside
* a note box, such as "DayNight" on a map or "Light/Fire/etc on an event.
*
* Examples:
*
* With the default note tag key, "CL" (not case sensitive):
* <CL: Light 250 #ffffff>
* <CL: Daynight>
* ...etc
*
* Without a note tag key set:
* Light 250 #ffffff
* Daynight
* ...etc
*
* Using a note tag key is recommended since it allows for other things
* (plugins, or even you rown personal notes) to make use of the note box
* without breaking things.  Omiting the key is intended primarily as legacy
* support, allowing this plugin to be used with older projects that use Terrax
* Lighting so they don't have to go back and change a bunch of event and map
* notes.
*
* Notation characters:
* []   Values are optional (the brightness parameter in light, etc)
* |    Select the value from the specified list (on|off, etc)
*
* Do not include these in the actual plugin commands.

* closer to it.
* 
* It can be changed in the plugin parameters, or using the script call...
*
* $gameVariables.SetActiveRadius(#)
*
* ....where # is the max distance you want in tiles.

# Dev Notes
Automatically Pretty JSON data files for pre-commit
**This will make json files more readable for easier code reviews**

Used below Tutorial and modified script to suit this project.
https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/automatically-pretty-json-files-for-clean-git-commit-diffs-using-git-hooks.108122/

This is a client side hook so all developers need to update their `.git/hooks/pre-commit` with what I have provided. 
hooks/pre-commit-1.0.js

Developers can just rename to `pre-commit` (no extension) then copy and paste in .git/hooks/

When updates are needed the shared hook should be updated and the local .git hook can be found here and also be updated.
